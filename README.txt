=========================================

Cutupsampler is a program for Mac OS X that performs a cut-up of a sound file
and maps the various cuts to keys on a MIDI keyboard or computer keyboard.

Whereas most samplers are concerned with playing a particular sample at
musical pitches on the keyboard, or playing discrete samples that are mapped
individually to specific keys, Cutupsampler's approach is to divide a single
sound among multiple keys - fracturing the original sound, without any
attempt to transpose the cuts to musical pitches.

When you load a sound into Cutupsampler, it slices the sound up into a
controllable number of cuts. However, with Cutupsampler, some amount of
control is deliberately lost to the cut-up phenomenon, since sound is mapped
out evenly among the specified number of keys. Aspects of the original sound
can be discovered by performing its fragments outside of their original
sequence. Some cuts may be useful to you and some may not. You can experiment
with changing the number of cuts, and seeing where their boundaries lie, by
changing the number of keys over which the original sample is mapped. There is
no ability at the moment to control where the cuts are made (for example, at
beats or transients, or spaced out by hand at irregular intervals), but it is
possible that such functionality could be added in a later version.
Cutupsampler's driving design goal up to this point has been to provide more
of a cut-up experience, where a certain degree of control is relinquished to
the act of (semi) randomly cutting up the sound and then playing with the
fragments.

Though it does not attempt to be an all-purpose sampler or synthesizer, it has
a number of options for shaping its sound in real-time. You can shift its
playback speed, play it forward or reverse, make the cuts loop while their
keys are pressed, assign all of the keys an amplitude envelope, and add
tremolo, ring modulation, and vibrato effects.
