<p>Cutupsampler is a program for Mac OS X that performs a cut-up of
a sound file and maps the various cuts to keys on a MIDI keyboard or
computer keyboard.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><em>If</em> you're using a MIDI controller (e.g. keyboard or
		other such device):
		<ol>
			<li>Select an appropriate device from the "MIDI dev" menu.</li>
			<li>Select the MIDI channel on which the device will be
			transmitting, from the "MIDI ch" box.</li>
			<li>Adjust "# keys" to cut the audio sample file up into more or
			fewer chunks. each chunk will be mapped to a key/note of the MIDI
			controller. Adjust "low key" to define the key to use as the start of
			the total, overall sample.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li><em>If</em> you want to use the computer keyboard:
		<ol>
			<li>In the "controller" panel, select "computer kbd".</li>
		</ol>
		</li>

	<p>The computer keyboard does not attempt to emulate a clavier
	keyboard; in other words, there are no black and white keys.</p>
	
	<p>"Low key" box becomes irrelevant and is disabled. Use the "#
	keys" box to control the number of computer-keyboard keys into which the
	sound sample is divided. The number of active keys are counted from the
	top-left alphabetic key, going across and then down.</p>

		<h1>Known issues</h1>
	</header>

	<p>Dragging mouse in dial while using the computer keyboard. Use
	space key to stop all held notes.</p>
	
	<p>Computer keyboard only allows 6 notes at once. Not sure if this
	is the keyboard's circuitry or OS X, but that's the way it is.</p>
