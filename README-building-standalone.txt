Building Cutupsampler as a standalone in Max/MSP
================================================

General requirements
--------------------

You need the midityping.maxpat patcher and its 'support' folder within
your Max/MSP search path.  As of version 1.0, this is included in the
source zip file.


Building as a standalone
------------------------

After the application build has completed in Max/MSP, copy the contents
of ./support (in this directory) to the 'support' folder inside of the
application package.  (Control-click the application & choose "show package
contents")  Also copy the contents of the midityping patcher's 'support'
folder to the application's 'support' folder.
